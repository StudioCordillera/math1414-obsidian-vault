# Specs Inbox

Drop any stray/accidental spec files here. We will triage and file them to the correct location.

Guidance:
- Node standards → Node Standard.md
- Relations vocabulary → Relations - Relation Types.md
- Tags taxonomy → Tags Taxonomy.md
- Templates → System/Templates/

Triage checklist:
- Rename to canonical title
- Move to System/Specs/
- Update links in dashboards/templates if needed
- Delete the stray copy
