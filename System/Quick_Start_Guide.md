## 🚀 HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM

### STEP 1: Learn the Language
**Open**: [[02_Concepts/Vocabulary_Guide|Vocabulary Guide]]

**Use it when you encounter**:
- Unfamiliar category theory terms (morphism, functor, etc.)
- Method signatures you don't understand
- Cross-references in other documents

**How to search**:
1. Press Ctrl+F
2. Type the term (e.g., "morphism")
3. Read definition + related concepts

**Example**:
```
You're reading and see: "complete_square_transform()"
→ Search vocab guide for "transform"
→ Find: "Transformation Morphism"
→ Learn: Changes form while preserving solutions
→ See related: @VERTEX_FORM, @STANDARD_FORM
```

---

### STEP 2: Track Your Progress
**Open**: [[System/Archive_Status_Report|Archive Status Report]]

**Use it to**:
- See which of 21 learning objectives you've mastered
- Identify gaps in your knowledge
- Understand what still needs work

**Navigate to**:
- "Learning Objectives Status" section (page ~90)
- Find your current topic
- Check status: Template ✅ vs Examples ❌

---

### STEP 3: Study from Examples
**Open**: [[01_Course/Textbook/Chapter3_Method_Extractions|Chapter 3 Method Extractions]] (growing)

**Use it to**:
- See step-by-step worked problems
- Understand explicit AND implicit knowledge
- Learn common errors before you make them

**Study Pattern**:
1. Read the problem
2. Try it yourself
3. Compare your work to the extraction
4. Note the "Implicit Knowledge Required" section
5. Review "Common Errors" to avoid them

---

### STEP 4: Fill Your Templates
**Open**: [[01_Course/Exam_Resources/Exam2_Data_Entry_Companion|Exam2 Data Entry Companion]]

**Use it to**:
- Document YOUR worked examples
- Create YOUR own method library
- Build YOUR study resource

**Workflow**:
```
1. Work a practice problem
2. Find matching method in YAML
3. Fill in:
   - Your example
   - Your steps
   - Your notes
4. Repeat for each learning objective
```

---

### STEP 5: Quick Reference
**Open**: [[01_Course/Exam_Resources/Exam2_Quick_Reference|Exam2 Quick Reference Card]]

**Use it during**:
- Study sessions
- Problem-solving
- Exam review

**Keep it open** as your "cheat sheet"

## 💡 STUDY WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Scenario 1: Learning Completing the Square
```
1. Open Vocabulary Guide
   → Search "complete_square_transform"
   → Understand the morphism signature

2. Open Chapter3_Method_Extractions.md
   → Find Example 2 (p. 304)
   → Read the step-by-step

3. Work 3 practice problems yourself

4. Open Exam2_Data_Entry_Companion.yaml
   → Navigate to "Complete Square" section
   → Document your examples

5. Open Exam2_Quick_Reference_Card.md
   → Review the condensed version
   → Use during practice
```

### Scenario 2: Studying for Exam
```
1. Open Archive_Status_Report.md
   → Check which topics are "HIGH" priority
   → Make list of incomplete objectives

2. For each objective:
   a. Review in Vocab Guide
   b. Study examples in Extraction doc
   c. Practice problems
   d. Fill YAML template

3. Use Quick Reference Card for final review
```

### Scenario 3: Stuck on a Problem
```
1. Identify which method is needed
2. Search Vocabulary Guide for related terms
3. Find similar problem in Chapter3_Method_Extractions.md
4. Check "Common Errors" section
5. Review your YAML notes if you've filled them
```

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES ROADMAP

### Priority Order (Based on Exam Weight):

**CRITICAL (Do First)**:
1. Completing the square (Obj. 1)
2. Discriminant interpretation (Obj. 2)
3. Graph quadratics (Obj. 3)
4. Complex conjugate roots (Obj. 4)
5. Factoring/division (Obj. 7)
6. Synthetic division (Obj. 8)
7. Rational root theorem (Obj. 10)
8. Graph rationals (Obj. 11)

**IMPORTANT (Do Second)**:
9-21: All remaining objectives

## 🔄 ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT

This framework GROWS as you use it:

**Week 1**: Vocabulary + extraction reading
**Week 2**: Fill in YAML with your examples  
**Week 3**: Create compressed reference notes
**Week 4**: Full integration, exam-ready

---

## ❓ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't understand category theory terms"
→ That's exactly what the [[02_Concepts/Vocabulary_Guide|Vocabulary Guide]] is for!
→ Start with "Category Theory Core" section
→ Read definitions in order, they build on each other

### "The examples are too detailed"
→ Detailed = good for learning
→ After understanding, use [[01_Course/Exam_Resources/Exam2_Quick_Reference|Quick Reference]] for brevity
→ YAML format will help you compress knowledge

### "How do I know what to study?"
→ Open [[System/Archive_Status_Report|Archive Status Report]]
→ Look at "Learning Objectives Status" table
→ Focus on HIGH priority items with ❌ status

### "I need more examples"
→ [[01_Course/Textbook/Chapter3_Method_Extractions|Chapter 3 Method Extractions]] is growing
→ Add YOUR examples to YAML companion
→ Use textbook problems as source

## 🎓 PHILOSOPHY

This framework treats math as **relationships** not **rules**:

**Traditional Approach**:
"Memorize: x = -b ± √(b²-4ac) / 2a"

**Relational Approach**:
```
complete_square_transform: 
  Standard Form → Vertex Form
  Preserves: @SOLUTIONS
  Reveals: @VERTEX location
  Why it works: Creates perfect square
```

**Result**: Deeper understanding + better retention

---

## 🚨 MOST IMPORTANT

**Don't try to read everything at once!**

Use this as a **reference system**:
- Encounter unknown term → Look it up
- Need to learn method → Find example
- Review for exam → Use Quick Reference
- Document your work → Fill YAML

**The framework supports YOUR learning**
**Not the other way around**

**Welcome to relational-cognitive mathematics!**

*Your framework is ready. Now make it yours.*
