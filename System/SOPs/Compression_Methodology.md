# Compression Methodology
## Advanced Content Layering Standard Operating Procedure

> **Purpose**: Systematic approach to creating and maintaining multi-level content compression
> **Scope**: Complex mathematical concepts requiring different detail levels for different audiences
> **Foundation**: Cognitive load theory and expert-novice learning differences

---

## 🧠 THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

### Cognitive Load Theory Application
**Working Memory Limitations**: Humans can process 7±2 information chunks simultaneously
**Expert vs Novice Processing**: Experts use compressed knowledge schemas, novices need explicit detail
**Compression Benefits**: 
- Experts read faster with compressed references
- Novices get detail on demand without overwhelming experts
- System serves multiple user sophistication levels

### Mathematical Communication Levels
1. **Expert Communication**: Symbolic, assumes extensive background
2. **Professional Communication**: Balanced symbols and explanation  
3. **Educational Communication**: Scaffolded, comprehensive explanation

### Knowledge Compression Patterns
- **Notation Compression**: Full mathematical expressions → symbolic shortcuts
- **Process Compression**: Step-by-step procedures → expert patterns
- **Context Compression**: Full explanations → assumed background knowledge
- **Example Compression**: Multiple examples → prototypical instances

## 🎯 COMPRESSION ANALYSIS

### Step 1: Compression Candidate Identification
**Timeline**: 15 minutes per concept

#### Candidate Criteria Assessment:
- [ ] **Usage Frequency**: Concept referenced 5+ times across system
- [ ] **Complexity Level**: Concept requires >2 sentences to explain fully
- [ ] **Audience Variation**: Different users need different detail levels
- [ ] **Cognitive Load**: Full explanation interrupts reading flow

#### Analysis Questions:
1. **Who references this concept?**
   - Experts building on the concept (compressed references)
   - Practitioners applying the concept (standard references)
   - Learners studying the concept (expanded references)

2. **In what contexts is it referenced?**
   - Quick application contexts (need compression)
   - Problem-solving contexts (need standard detail)
   - Teaching/learning contexts (need full expansion)

3. **What prerequisite knowledge varies?**
   - Expert users: Assume extensive mathematical background
   - Standard users: Assume basic mathematical literacy
   - Learning users: Assume minimal prerequisite knowledge

#### Compression Priority Matrix:
```
High Usage + High Complexity = PRIORITY 1 (compress immediately)
High Usage + Low Complexity = PRIORITY 2 (consider compression)
Low Usage + High Complexity = PRIORITY 3 (defer compression)
Low Usage + Low Complexity = NO COMPRESSION (standard references only)
