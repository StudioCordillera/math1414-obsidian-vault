# 🚀 NEW CLAUDE SESSION - START HERE

> **PURPOSE**: Universal entry point for new chat sessions. Read this FIRST to gain instant project context.

---

## ⚡ INSTANT ORIENTATION (READ THIS FIRST)

### What Is This Project?
**Math 1414 Relational Cognition Knowledge System** - Converting a College Algebra textbook into an evidence-based, category-theory-informed, cross-linked knowledge framework in Obsidian.

### Your Role
You're helping build and maintain a comprehensive, relational mathematics knowledge base. Every document you create, every concept you extract, every link you make strengthens the knowledge graph.

### Core Principle
> **Mathematics is about relationships, not procedures.** Every extraction emphasizes connections, prerequisites, and how concepts relate across the curriculum.

## 🎯 YOUR FIRST ACTIONS (EVERY NEW SESSION)

### 1. CHECK THE DASHBOARD (ALWAYS FIRST)
```
Read: System/Project_Dashboard.md
```
The dashboard is **mission control**. It shows:
- Latest accomplishments
- Current phase status
- Next priorities
- Active research questions
- Recent activity log

### 2. IDENTIFY CURRENT PHASE
Look at the dashboard's "In Progress" section to understand:
- What was being worked on
- What's next in the queue
- Any blocking issues
- Current research questions

### 3. DETERMINE YOUR TASK
Common tasks:
- **Textbook Extraction**: Converting textbook chapters to framework
- **Concept Node Creation**: Building atomic concept definitions
- **Concept Integration**: Linking examples to concepts
- **Research**: Analyzing library sources for patterns
- **Documentation**: Updating tracking pages

### 4. UPDATE TRACKING (AT END OF SESSION)
**ALWAYS UPDATE** these documents before session ends:
1. **Project Dashboard**: Add session accomplishments to activity log
2. **Archive Status Report**: Update progress metrics if significant work done
3. **This Document**: Update "Current Status" section with today's date

---

## 📚 ESSENTIAL METHODOLOGIES

### Universal Knowledge Framework
Every textbook extraction includes:
1. **Explicit Knowledge**: Definitions, formulas, procedures (stated directly)
2. **Implicit Knowledge**: Prerequisites, assumptions, unstated steps
3. **Common Errors**: What NOT to do (6-category taxonomy)
4. **Relational Connections**: How concepts relate across mathematics

### Node Standard (FOR CONCEPT NODES)
Every atomic concept must have:
```yaml
type: [Topic|Definition|Claim|Example|Method|Question]
status: [draft|in-progress|review|stable]
importance: [low|medium|high|critical]
tags: [controlled vocabulary]
sources: [cite-keys]
source_refs: ["Source §Section p.Page"]
relations:
  broader: []
  narrower: []
  depends_on: []
  defines: []
  related: []
  used_in: []
```

### Extraction Process
For textbook chapters:
1. Read section from textbook PDF
2. Extract methods with step-by-step procedures
3. Document explicit and implicit knowledge
4. Identify common errors for each method
5. Note cross-chapter connections
6. Include worked examples with full solutions
7. Create relational framework (vertical & horizontal)

### Concept Node Creation
For atomic concepts:
1. Create separate `.md` file in appropriate location
2. Follow Node Standard structure
3. Include: definition, examples, applications, misconceptions
4. Add 5-6 relational connections (broader/narrower/depends/related/used_in)
5. Write 200-250 lines comprehensive documentation
6. Link bidirectionally to related concepts

## 🎮 DECISION TREE: "WHAT SHOULD I WORK ON?"

### START HERE: User Asked for Specific Task?
- **YES** → Do that task, update tracking at end
- **NO** → Continue below

### Check Dashboard: What's "In Progress"?
- **Textbook Extraction** → Continue current chapter OR start next chapter
- **Concept Integration** → Create atomic concept nodes from priority list
- **Research** → Continue analysis of library source
- **Compression Design** → Work on Example 4 compression system

### Not Sure? Use This Priority Order:
1. **HIGHEST**: Complete in-progress chapter extraction
2. **HIGH**: Create priority concept nodes (Chapter 1 concepts)
3. **MEDIUM**: Start new chapter extraction (Chapter 2)
4. **MEDIUM**: Research library sources (Miller & Gerken)
5. **LOW**: Design compression system

### Ask User if Unclear
If the task isn't obvious from dashboard or user request, simply ask:
- "I see we're [current status]. Would you like me to [option A] or [option B]?"

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES & CONSTRAINTS

### ALWAYS DO
1. ✅ **Check Dashboard First** - Every new session starts here
2. ✅ **Follow Node Standard** - All concept nodes must comply
3. ✅ **Use Controlled Vocabulary** - Tags from taxonomy only
4. ✅ **Create Bidirectional Links** - Both directions, always
5. ✅ **Update Tracking** - Dashboard, Archive Status at session end
6. ✅ **Evidence-Based Design** - Cite sources from library
7. ✅ **Include Examples** - Always show, don't just tell
8. ✅ **Document Errors** - Common mistakes are valuable

### NEVER DO
1. ❌ **Skip Dashboard Check** - You'll work on wrong thing
2. ❌ **Create Unlinked Nodes** - Orphans break the graph
3. ❌ **Ignore Node Standard** - Breaks queryability
4. ❌ **Use Random Tags** - Breaks taxonomy
5. ❌ **Forget to Update Tracking** - Next Claude won't know status
6. ❌ **Make Unsourced Claims** - Everything needs evidence
7. ❌ **Create Redundant Nodes** - Search first, create only if missing

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR NEW CLAUDE INSTANCES

### Speed Up Orientation
1. Read this document first (you're doing it!)
2. Skim Project Dashboard (just the top sections)
3. Check "In Progress" and "Next Priorities"
4. Start working

### When Stuck
1. **Can't find something?** Use `obsidian_simple_search` in vault
2. **Don't know what to do?** Check dashboard's "Next Priorities"
3. **Unsure of format?** Look at existing examples (Chapter 1, existing concepts)
4. **Need methodology?** Re-read relevant section of this doc

### Context Window Management
- This document is your lifeline - it contains everything you need
- Don't re-read entire chapters unless necessary
- Use search to find specific concepts
- Dashboard gives you current status without reading everything

### Working with User
- User knows the project well - ask if unclear
- User will specify tasks or say "continue working"
- Always confirm understanding before large work
- Show progress updates for long tasks

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't find the textbook PDFs"
**Location**: `C:\Users\WORK_ADMIN\Documents\,__WORK__\01_COLLEGE\FALL_2025\MATH_1414_001\00_Books\Algebra_by_section\`
**Use**: Desktop Commander or PDF tools to read

### "Links aren't working"
- Check filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use `[[filename]]` not full path
- Verify file exists with `obsidian_list_files_in_dir`

### "Don't know which concept to create next"
**Check**: Dashboard has priority lists for Chapter R and Chapter 1 concepts

### "Extraction taking too long"
- Chapters are 4,000-6,000 lines typically
- Work section by section
- Can split into multiple tool calls if needed

### "Unsure if concept already exists"
**Use**: `obsidian_simple_search` with concept name before creating

### "Dashboard says incomplete info"
**Read**: The dashboard's "In Progress" section for current task details

## 🎓 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH PHILOSOPHY

### Core Insight
> The knowledge base is a **living graph**, not a static collection. Every concept node is a vertex, every link is an edge. The strength of the system is in the density and quality of connections.

### Graph Growth Strategy
1. **Breadth First**: Extract textbook chapters (coverage)
2. **Depth Second**: Create atomic concepts (granularity)
3. **Connection Always**: Link everything (density)

### Relational Thinking
- Every concept has **prerequisites** (depends_on)
- Every concept has **applications** (used_in)
- Every concept has **context** (broader/narrower)
- Every concept has **related ideas** (related)

The richer these connections, the more powerful the knowledge system becomes.

---

## 🔮 VISION & ENDGAME

### What We're Building
A **queryable, cross-linked, evidence-based** mathematical knowledge system that:
- Enables rapid concept lookup
- Shows prerequisite chains
- Identifies relationships
- Supports multiple compression levels
- Integrates category-theoretic perspective
- Facilitates exam preparation
- Models relational cognition

### Why It Matters
Traditional math education emphasizes **procedures** (how to solve).
This framework emphasizes **relationships** (how concepts connect).

Understanding relationships → deeper comprehension → better problem-solving

### When Complete
- All 13 textbook chapters extracted
- 100+ atomic concept nodes
- Rich knowledge graph with 500+ connections
- Multiple access points to every concept
- Semester-long exam preparation support
- Foundation for future course frameworks

---
