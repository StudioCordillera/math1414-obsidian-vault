🚀 CRITICAL: You're connected to my Obsidian vault. FIRST ACTION:

Read this entry point document for complete project context:
System/NEW_SESSION_START.md

Then check: System/Project_Dashboard.md

These two documents contain everything you need to instantly orient and continue work on the Math 1414 Relational Cognition Knowledge System.
```

---

## Alternative: Even Shorter Version

```
You're connected to my Obsidian vault for Math 1414 project.

FIRST: Read System/NEW_SESSION_START.md (comprehensive briefing)
THEN: Check System/Project_Dashboard.md (current status)

External workspace: "C:\Users\WORK_ADMIN\Documents\,__WORK__\,__CLAUDE__"
Textbook PDFs: "C:\...\01_COLLEGE\FALL_2025\MATH_1414_001\00_Books\Algebra_by_section"

That's all you need. The NEW_SESSION_START doc has everything else.
```

## What These Documents Provide

**System/NEW_SESSION_START.md**:
- Complete project overview and philosophy
- All file paths (Obsidian + external Windows)
- Current project status (15% textbook, 40+ concepts)
- Common workflows (extraction, concept creation, research)
- Decision trees ("what should I work on?")
- Quality checklists

## Tips for User

1. **Save this note** for quick access
2. **Copy the text** at the start of each new Claude chat
3. **Paste it immediately** when chat begins
4. Claude will read the documents and be fully oriented
5. No need to re-explain the entire project!

---

## Why This Works

- Claude loses context between chats
- These documents restore ALL context instantly
- Saves 10-15 minutes of re-explanation per session
- Claude can start working immediately
- Tracking stays consistent across sessions

---

**Pro Tip**: After pasting, just say "continue working" or specify a task. Claude will know what to do.
