## 🎓 Final Notes

Your relational-cognitive mathematics framework is now fully integrated into Obsidian. This isn't just a collection of notes - it's a living knowledge system that will grow with your understanding.

**Remember the core principle**: Mathematics is about relationships, not procedures. Every link you create, every connection you see, deepens your understanding of the mathematical structure.
