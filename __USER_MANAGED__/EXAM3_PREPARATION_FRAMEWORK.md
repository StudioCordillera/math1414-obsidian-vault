## STRATEGIC APPROACH

### Phase 1: Primary Focus Areas (Weeks 1-2)
**Chapter 4: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**
- 4.1 Inverse Functions → 4.6 Modeling (Complete coverage)
- Emphasis: Properties of logarithms, solving equations, real-world applications

**Chapter 9: Systems of Equations** 
- 9.1 Two Variables → 9.5 Inequalities (Selected high-impact sections)
- Emphasis: Linear systems, three-variable systems, nonlinear systems

### Phase 2: Secondary Support (Week 3)
**Chapter 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions**
- Focus on zeros, rational functions, and inequalities
- Connection to exponential/logarithmic solving methods

**Chapter 2: Function Operations**
- 2.8 Algebra of Functions and Composition
- Foundation for inverse function understanding

### Phase 3: Integration and Practice (Week 4)
- Mixed problem sets across all chapters
- Timed practice sessions
- Error pattern analysis and remediation
