## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: User Content Acquisition
**What I need from you:**
1. **Which specific chapter/section exercises** you want me to create databases for
2. **Actual textbook content** via one of these methods:
   - Scanned pages of exercise sections
   - Typed out problems (10-15 at a time)
   - Screenshots of exercise pages
   - Digital textbook copy-paste

### Step 2: Verification Protocol
**Before any database creation:**
1. I'll read back the first 3 problems to you for accuracy confirmation
2. You'll verify the problem numbers and exact wording match your textbook
3. Only after your approval will I proceed with the full section

### Step 3: Database Creation Process
**Following verified content:**
1. Create `[DRAFT]_Chapter[X]_Section_[X.X]_Exercises.md` files
2. Extract exactly as written in your textbook
3. Mark as `[VERIFIED]` only after your final approval
4. Create realistic study plans based on actual problem counts
