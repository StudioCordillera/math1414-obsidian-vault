# Chapter 3 — Core Concept Node Checklist

Purpose: Track creation/QC of core Chapter 3 concept nodes. Append-only audit lines; do not rewrite SOP/templates.

## Core Concepts (Create/Audit)
- [x] [[02_Concepts/What_IS_a_Polynomial]]
- [x] [[02_Concepts/End_Behavior]]
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Root_Multiplicity]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Standard_Form]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Factored_Form]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Working_From_Factored_Form]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Constructing_Polynomials_from_Roots]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Finding_Polynomial_Roots]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Remainder_Theorem]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Factor_Theorem]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Rational_Root_Theorem]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Division_Algorithm]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Synthetic_Division]]
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Polynomial_Degree_and_Shape]]

## Audit Log
- 2025-10-21 — Initialized Chapter 3 checklist; verified existing nodes for What_IS_a_Polynomial, End_Behavior, Root_Multiplicity; created checklist.

## Audit Log Update - 2025-10-23

### Batch C Audit Complete ✅
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Constructing_Polynomials_from_Roots]] - Verified review status
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Finding_Polynomial_Roots]] - Verified review status  
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Remainder_Theorem]] - Verified review status
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Factor_Theorem]] - Verified review status
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Rational_Root_Theorem]] - Verified review status
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Division_Algorithm]] - Verified review status
- [x] [[02_Concepts/Synthetic_Division]] - Verified review status

### Issue Identified:
- [ ] [[02_Concepts/Polynomial_Degree_and_Shape]] - Missing Node Standard YAML frontmatter (needs correction)

**Batch C Summary**: 7 nodes verified at review status with proper Node Standard compliance, cross-links confirmed bidirectional. All theorem/method nodes in polynomial division chain are complete and properly structured.

**Next Action**: Fix Polynomial_Degree_and_Shape frontmatter, then proceed to next chapter concepts or continue Chapter 3 integration.
