Category Theory: Basics

Summary
- Category theory studies structures via morphisms and universal properties, prioritizing relationships over elements.

Key ideas
- Categories: objects, morphisms, identity, associative composition
- Diagrams and commutativity as proofs
- Products, coproducts, equalizers, pullbacks defined by universal properties
- Isomorphism vs equivalence of categories (up to structure)

Definitions
- Category C: Ob(C), Hom(X,Y), id_X, g∘f with associativity and identities
- Product X×Y: object with projections π1, π2 s.t. for any Z and f:Z→X, g:Z→Y, ∃! ⟨f,g⟩:Z→X×Y with π1∘⟨f,g⟩=f, π2∘⟨f,g⟩=g

Examples
- Set, Top, Grp, Ab, Vec_k; preorders and monoids as thin/one-object categories

Relations
- Builds foundations for: Universal Properties, Functors/Natural Transformations, Adjoint Functors

Cross-source synthesis
- Universal properties as the organizing lens (Lawvere & Schanuel; SEP; Smith): prefer characterization-by-mapping problems over element-wise constructions.
- Equivalence over isomorphism as the correct notion of sameness of structure (Lawvere & Schanuel; SEP).
- Foundational contrast: set-first vs relation-first perspectives (Lawvere & Rosebrugh; Gowers et al.).
