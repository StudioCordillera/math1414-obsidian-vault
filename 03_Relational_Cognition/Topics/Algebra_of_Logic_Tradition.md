Algebra of Logic Tradition

Summary
- Classical algebraic logic (Boole, Peirce, Schröder) and links to categorical viewpoints.

Key ideas
- Boolean algebras, relation algebras; dualities (Stone); categorical recasting

Examples
- Stone duality as equivalence; algebraic semantics vs categorical semantics

Relations
- Bridges to Categorical Logic and Toposes; informs Concept Mapping semantics

Sources
- The Algebra of Logic Tradition (two PDFs)
- SEP Category Theory (duality sections)

Cross-source synthesis
- Historical algebraization of logic (Boole, Peirce, Schröder) anticipates categorical treatments: algebraic semantics for inference.
- Connects to modern structures: Boolean/Heyting algebras, lattices of subobjects, and classifiers in a topos.
- Relevance to relational cognition: logical entailment modeled as order/enrichment; composition captures syllogistic chaining.
