Functors and Natural Transformations

Summary
- Functors map categories, preserving composition and identities; natural transformations compare functors via component morphisms that respect arrows.

Key ideas
- F:C→D; naturality squares; natural isomorphisms
- Yoneda lemma: objects determined by their morphisms (representables)

Examples
- Power set functor; forgetful functors; free/forgetful adjunction components are natural

Relations
- Yoneda underpins topic organization by relations; links to Adjoint Functors; Graphical Regular Logic depicts naturality

Cross-source synthesis
- Functors preserve identities and composition; structure-preservation emphasizes relationships between shapes of diagrams.
- Natural transformations: components η_X making squares commute; natural isomorphisms witness equivalence of presentations.
- Equivalences of categories: fully faithful + essentially surjective ⇔ existence of quasi-inverse up to natural iso.
- Practice: express “sameness” of constructions via naturality rather than pointwise equality.
