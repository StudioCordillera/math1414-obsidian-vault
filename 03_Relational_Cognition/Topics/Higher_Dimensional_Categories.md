Higher-Dimensional Categories

Summary
- Extends categories with 2-morphisms and beyond; core to modern math and semantics.

Key ideas
- 2-categories, bicategories, n-categories, (∞,1)-categories
- Groupoids; homotopy hypotheses; equivalences up to higher cells

Examples
- Cat as a 2-category; fundamental groupoid Π1(X)

Relations
- Interfaces with Homotopy Type Theory; Categorical Logic in higher settings; Applications to cognition via compositional hierarchies

- SEP: Category Theory (sections on higher categories)

Cross-source synthesis
- From 1-categories to n- and ∞-categories: morphisms between morphisms (2-cells, etc.) with compositions and coherence laws.
- Strict vs weak higher categories; coherence theorems govern when equality can be replaced by isomorphism up to higher cells.
- String diagrams as a practical calculus for 2-categorical/monoidal reasoning; emphasize locality and compositionality.
