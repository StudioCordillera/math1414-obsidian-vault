Universal Properties: Limits and Colimits

Summary
- Constructions are determined up to unique isomorphism by universal mapping properties; this underpins products, equalizers, pullbacks, etc.

Key ideas
- Cones and cocones to diagrams D:J→C
- Limit: terminal cone; Colimit: initial cocone
- Stability and preservation by adjoints (right adjoints preserve limits; left adjoints preserve colimits)

Examples
- Pullback as limit of span X→Z←Y; Pushout as colimit of cospan X←Z→Y

Relations
- Interface with Adjoint Functors (preservation), Functors/Naturality (lim as end), Categorical Logic (limits for conjunction)

Cross-source synthesis
- Universal properties characterize constructions up to unique isomorphism; proofs use mapping properties rather than element-chasing.
- Limits as terminal cones; colimits as initial cocones. Products, equalizers, pullbacks and their duals as core cases.
- Representability: many constructions arise as instances of representing objects/functors; uniqueness follows from Yoneda-style arguments.
- Heuristics: to prove two constructions coincide, build mutually inverse mediating morphisms via the universal property.
