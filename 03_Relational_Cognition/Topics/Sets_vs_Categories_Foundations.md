Foundations: Sets vs Categories

Summary
- Comparative view of set-theoretic and categorical foundations; emphasis on practice-driven equivalences and adjunctions.

Key ideas
- ETCS, topos foundations; structuralism; internal vs external perspectives

Examples
- ETCS axioms vs ZFC; working up to equivalence; choices of universe levels

Relations
- Pulls together Categorical Logic/Toposes, Adjoint Functors; informs how Topic notes treat identity and reference

Sources
- SEP: Category Theory (foundational sections)
- Lawvere & Rosebrugh, Sets for Mathematics
- Mac Lane, various essays (if added)

Cross-source synthesis
- Set-first (ZFC-style) vs structure-first (categorical) foundations: ETCS/structural set theory emphasizes morphisms and universal properties.
- Elements-as-morphisms from 1 contrasts with membership-centric reasoning; supports replacement of element-chasing by diagram chasing.
- Analysis texts (e.g., Carothers) illustrate set-theoretic development; categorical approach reframes core constructions via limits/colimits.
