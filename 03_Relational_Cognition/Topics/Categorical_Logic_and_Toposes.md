Categorical Logic and Toposes

Summary
- Logic internal to categories; toposes as generalized universes supporting rich internal logic.

Key ideas
- Regular/coherent/Heyting/Boolean categories; internal language
- Topos: finite limits, exponentials, subobject classifier; geometric logic
- Quantifiers as adjoints to substitution

Examples
- Sheaves on a topological space; Effective topos; Stone duality

Relations
- Links to Foundations; Algebra of Logic; Graphical logics; Topic merges with Sets vs Categories where needed

Sources
- SEP: Category Theory (logic/topos sections)
- Mac Lane & Moerdijk, Sheaves in Geometry and Logic (if added)
- Lawvere & Rosebrugh, Sets for Mathematics

Cross-source synthesis
- Internal logics: regular and coherent fragments correspond to categorical structure (finite limits, images; finite limits + finite colimits + stable unions).
- Topos highlights: subobject classifier Ω, exponentials, finite limits; internal intuitionistic higher-order logic.
- Diagrammatic reasoning (regular logic via string diagrams) supplies a usable syntax matching categorical semantics.
