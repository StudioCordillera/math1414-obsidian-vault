Adjoint Functors

Summary
- Adjoint pairs (F ⊣ G) capture universal problems; many core constructions arise as adjoints.

Key ideas
- Unit η: Id ⇒ GF; Counit ε: FG ⇒ Id; triangle identities
- Left adjoints preserve colimits; right adjoints preserve limits
- Free/forgetful, (−)×X ⊣ (−)^X in cartesian closed categories

Examples
- Free group ⊣ forgetful Set→Grp; Stone–Čech compactification as left adjoint to inclusion

Relations
- Central to Limits/Colimits, Categorical Logic (quantifiers as adjoints), Foundations

Cross-source synthesis
- Adjoint pair F ⊣ G captured by natural bijection Hom(FX, Y) ≅ Hom(X, GY) with unit η and counit ε satisfying triangle identities.
- Viewpoint: universal arrows; free–forgetful constructions as paradigms (e.g., Free: Set→Grp left adjoint to U:Grp→Set).
- Heuristic: left adjoints preserve colimits; right adjoints preserve limits—use to predict existence/behavior of constructions.
