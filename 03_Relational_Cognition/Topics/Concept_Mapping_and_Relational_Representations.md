Concept Mapping and Relational Representations

Summary
- Concept maps and relational diagrams as cognitive tools; alignment with categorical structures emphasizes relations over nodes.

Key ideas
- Nodes as types, edges as morphisms/relations; compositional inference; constraints as limits/pullbacks

Examples
- Novak & Cañas history and principles; mapping topic interdependencies; taxonomy vs relation graphs

Relations
- Uses Graphical Regular Logic; integrates with Topic notes as cross-links; may pull from Algebra of Logic tradition

Sources
- Novak & Cañas, Origins of Concept Mapping
- Fong & Spivak (visual logic) for method

Contributions (Novak & Cañas)
- Concept maps as tools for externalizing relational knowledge structures.
- Propositions = labeled links between concepts; hierarchical structure supports progressive differentiation and integrative reconciliation.
- Relevance: bridges cognitive representations with categorical/relational modeling.
