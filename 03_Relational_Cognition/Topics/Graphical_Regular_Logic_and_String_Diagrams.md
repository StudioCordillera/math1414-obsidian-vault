Graphical Regular Logic and String Diagrams

Summary
- Diagrammatic calculi for reasoning about relations, functions, and processes.

Key ideas
- Regular logic fragments; compositionality; monoidal categories; traced/compact structures

Examples
- Fong & Spivak’s GRL; string diagrams for naturality and adjunctions

Relations
- Connects to Functors/Naturality, Adjoint Functors; supports cognition topics via visual reasoning and concept maps

Sources
- Fong & Spivak (2019), Graphical Regular Logic
- Joyal & Street (string diagrams) as background if added

Contributions (Fong & Spivak 2019)
- Focus: regular logic fragment represented via string diagrams; compositional reasoning about relations.
- Key constructs: objects as types, morphisms as relations; monoidal product encodes conjunction; existence corresponds to regular logic existential.
- Takeaway: diagrammatic calculus provides a tractable syntax for relational reasoning aligned with categorical semantics.
