Coverage tracker
- Category theory: foundations, basic definitions, universal properties, adjunctions, limits/colimits, functors, natural transformations
- Higher categories: n-categories, groupoids, homotopy type theory (as needed for cognition relations)
- Logical interfaces: categorical logic, toposes, regular/coherent/Heyting categories
- Representational tools: string diagrams, graphical regular logic, concept maps
- Applications to cognition: concept mapping, analogy, structural representations

Next steps
1) Seed initial topic notes from identified publications (content-first synthesis)
2) Backfill Sources sections per topic from Publications.md
3) Iterate: merge overlapping topics; split oversized ones
