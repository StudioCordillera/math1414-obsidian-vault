Relational Cognition Project

Purpose
- Build a topic-centered knowledge base from books and scholarly articles in the Relational Library.
- Notes are organized by content (topics, concepts, relations), not by individual sources.

Principles
- Topics-first: One topic can aggregate insights from many sources. A source-only note is used only if absolutely necessary.
- Cross-links: Prefer linking related topics over duplicating content.
- Provenance: Each topic note records which publications informed its content (Sources section), but the narrative is synthesized.

Structure
- Publications.md — canonical list of books/articles in the corpus
- Topics/ — topic notes (content-first)
- Topics/_Index.md — topic map and coverage tracker

Conventions
- Definitions and statements are written in your own words; cite canonical sources for formal statements.
- Use short sections: Summary, Key ideas, Definitions, Examples, Relations, Sources.
- When multiple sources disagree, record the distinctions under Relations > Divergences.
Scope and control
- This group is actively maintained and curated. Canonical specs live under Relational Cognition Corpus/Standards and System/Specs.
- Content-first, topic-centric. Multi-source aggregation with source trails at note bottoms.

Dashboards
- See Relational Cognition Corpus/Dashboards for QA and Claims dashboards.

Notes
- If a spec/template lands here accidentally, move it to System/Specs/_Inbox.
