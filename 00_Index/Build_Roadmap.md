# Algebraic Concept Collection - Build Roadmap
*Systematic Completionist Construction Plan*

---

## 🎯 MISSION

Build a complete, interconnected algebraic knowledge system where:
- Every fundamental concept is fully developed
- Relations between concepts are explicit and visual
- Complex abstractions become simple through relational frameworks
- The "why" is as clear as the "how"
- A 5-year-old could understand the deepest ideas with the right scaffolding

---

## 🏗️ CONSTRUCTION PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

1. **Atomicity**: Break concepts down to their irreducible components
2. **Composability**: Show how atoms combine into molecules
3. **Morphisms First**: Every operation is a transformation/mapping
4. **Visual Relations**: Make implicit connections explicit
5. **Layered Abstraction**: Symbol → Structure → Intuition → Essence
6. **Bidirectionality**: Show both directions of every relationship

### Module Structure Template

Each concept module should contain:

```

## 🔄 ITERATION STRATEGY

For each concept:
1. **Draft**: Get the structure down
2. **Deepen**: Add relational frameworks
3. **Visualize**: Create diagrams
4. **Connect**: Link to other concepts
5. **Simplify**: Refine to essence
6. **Test**: Can a 5-year-old follow the chain?

---

## 💭 GUIDING QUESTIONS

For every concept, ask:
- What is the **essence**?
- What are the **atoms**?
- How does it **compose**?
- What does it **morph to**?
- Why is it **inevitable**?
- What makes it **simple**?
