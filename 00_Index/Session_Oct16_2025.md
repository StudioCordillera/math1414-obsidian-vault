- Cross-linking could be even denser

**Innovation Highlights**:
- Remainder Theorem as "fortune teller" metaphor
- Factor Theorem bidirectional emphasis
- Function as "magical box" then morphism
- Polynomial as "LEGO blocks" then ring

*This session significantly strengthened the theoretical foundation of your algebraic concept collection. The addition of "What IS..." files provides the philosophical and structural grounding needed for all higher concepts to build upon.*

**Status**: Project is now well-positioned for systematic expansion through Phase 2 and beyond. The foundation is solid, the style is consistent, and the vision is clear.

---

**Next Session Recommendation**: Continue with remaining Phase 1 "What IS..." files (Variable, Expression, Equality, Relation) to complete the atomic concept layer before moving to Phase 2 deep dives.
