## 📐 QUADRATIC FORMULAS

### Forms
```
Standard:  f(x) = ax² + bx + c
Vertex:    f(x) = a(x - h)² + k
Factored:  f(x) = a(x - r₁)(x - r₂)
```

### Key Values
```
Vertex:         h = -b/(2a),  k = f(h)
Axis of sym:    x = h
Y-intercept:    (0, c)
Discriminant:   Δ = b² - 4ac
```

### Quadratic Formula
```
       -b ± √(b² - 4ac)
x = ─────────────────────
            2a
```

### Discriminant Classification
```
Δ > 0:  Two real roots
  ↳ Perfect square? → Rational
  ↳ Not perfect?    → Irrational

Δ = 0:  One repeated root (always rational)

Δ < 0:  Two complex conjugates (a ± bi)
```

## 🔢 POLYNOMIAL FORMULAS

### Degree & Behavior
```
Degree n → Max (n-1) turning points
Degree n → Exactly n roots (counting multiplicity + complex)
```

### End Behavior Rules
```
Even degree + Positive LC: ↑↑ (both up)
Even degree + Negative LC: ↓↓ (both down)
Odd degree + Positive LC:  ↓↑ (/ shape)
Odd degree + Negative LC:  ↑↓ (\ shape)
```

### Rational Root Theorem
```
Possible roots = ± (factors of a₀) / (factors of aₙ)
```

### Remainder Theorem
```
P(x) ÷ (x - c) → Remainder = P(c)
If remainder = 0 → (x - c) is a factor
```

### Synthetic Division Pattern
```
c | aₙ  aₙ₋₁  ...  a₁  a₀
  |      ↓     multiply & add
  └─────────────────────────
    aₙ   b₁    ...  bₙ₋₁  R
```

## 🔲 COMPLEX NUMBERS

### Powers of i
```
i¹ = i
i² = -1
i³ = -i
i⁴ = 1
Pattern repeats: i, -1, -i, 1, i, -1, -i, 1...

For i^n: divide n by 4, use remainder
```

### Complex Conjugates
```
If (a + bi) is root → (a - bi) is also root
Product: (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b²
Sum: (a + bi) + (a - bi) = 2a
```

### Quadratic Factor from Conjugates
```
Roots: (a + bi) and (a - bi)
Factor: x² - 2ax + (a² + b²)
```

---

## 📊 MULTIPLICITY

### Graph Behavior
```
ODD multiplicity → Graph CROSSES x-axis
EVEN multiplicity → Graph TOUCHES x-axis (bounces)
```

### Examples
```
(x - 2)¹  → crosses at x = 2
(x + 3)²  → touches at x = -3
(x - 1)³  → crosses with flat slope at x = 1
```

## 🎯 COMPLETING THE SQUARE

### Algorithm
```
Step 1: Factor out 'a' from x-terms
        f(x) = a(x² + (b/a)x) + c

Step 2: Add & subtract (b/2a)²
        f(x) = a(x² + (b/a)x + (b/2a)²) + c - a(b/2a)²

Step 3: Factor perfect square
        f(x) = a(x - h)² + k
```

### Quick Formula
```
For x² + bx → add (b/2)²
For ax² + bx → factor 'a' first, then use (b/2a)²
```

## 📈 OPTIMIZATION

### Standard Process
```
1. Define variables
2. Write constraint equation
3. Express one variable in terms of other
4. Write function to optimize
5. Find vertex (maximum or minimum)
6. Check: opens up (min) or down (max)?
```

### Quick Check
```
f(x) = ax² + bx + c

If a > 0: Opens up → Vertex is MINIMUM
If a < 0: Opens down → Vertex is MAXIMUM
```

## 🎨 RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

### Vertical Asymptotes
```
Set denominator = 0 (after reducing)
Solve for x
```

### Horizontal Asymptotes
```
Compare degrees:
  n < m: y = 0
  n = m: y = aₙ/bₘ (leading coefficients)
  n > m: None (check for slant)
```

### Holes
```
Common factors in numerator AND denominator
Cancel factor (x - c)
Hole at x = c
Find y-coordinate: plug c into reduced function
```

## ⚡ QUICK MENTAL MATH

### Perfect Squares (Memorize!)
```
1² = 1      6² = 36     11² = 121
2² = 4      7² = 49     12² = 144
3² = 9      8² = 64     13² = 169
4² = 16     9² = 81     14² = 196
5² = 25     10² = 100   15² = 225
```

### Common Products
```
4(1)(2) = 8      4(3)(5) = 60
4(1)(3) = 12     4(4)(5) = 80
4(2)(3) = 24     4(5)(6) = 120
4(2)(5) = 40
```

## 🚨 COMMON SIGN ERRORS

### Factor to Root
```
(x - 3) → root is x = 3    NOT x = -3
(x + 5) → root is x = -5   NOT x = 5
```

### Synthetic Division
```
Divide by (x + 3) → use c = -3  NOT c = 3
Divide by (x - 2) → use c = 2   NOT c = -2
```

### Complex Numbers
```
i² = -1    NOT +1, NOT 2i
(3 + 4i) conjugate → (3 - 4i)  NOT (-3 - 4i)
```

### Leading Coefficient
```
f(x) = 2(x - 1)(x + 3)
Expanding: DON'T forget the 2 in front!
```

## 💡 THE BIG 5 PATTERNS

### 1. Discriminant Decides Everything
```
One calculation → Know everything about roots
```

### 2. Complex Roots Come in Pairs
```
See one → Write its conjugate immediately
```

### 3. Degree Determines Shape
```
Even/Odd + Sign of LC → Predict entire graph
```

### 4. Multiplicity = Graph Behavior
```
Even → touch, Odd → cross
```

### 5. Vertex = Optimization
```
Max/min problem? → Find the vertex
```
