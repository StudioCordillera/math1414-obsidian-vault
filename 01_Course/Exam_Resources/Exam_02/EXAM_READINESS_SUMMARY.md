- [[01_Course/Exam_Resources/EXAM_TOPIC_INDEX]] ← Topic navigation

### Layer 2: Concept Entries (Your study materials)
- 18+ comprehensive entries in [[02_Concepts/]]
- Each follows relational cognition framework
- Core Insight → Foundation → Methods → Examples → Connections

### Layer 3: Theoretical Framework (Background support)
- [[Relational Cognition Corpus/Framework]] ← Category theory foundation
- [[Relational Cognition Corpus/Topics/_Index]] ← Theoretical scaffolding
- [[02_Concepts/Concept_Library]] ← Cross-reference vocabulary

## 🎯 EXAM STRATEGY (Read Before You Go)

### Time Management
1. **First 5 minutes:** Skim entire exam, mark easy problems
2. **Next 45 minutes:** Do all problems you're confident about
3. **Last 40 minutes:** Tackle harder problems, use systematic methods
4. **Final 10 minutes:** CHECK YOUR WORK (plug roots back in!)

### Problem-Solving Priority
1. **Read carefully:** What are they REALLY asking?
2. **Identify morphism chain:** What's the input? What transformation? What's the output?
3. **Check for special cases:** Discriminant < 0? Missing terms? Multiplicity?
4. **Show your work:** Partial credit is real
5. **Verify:** Does your answer make sense? Plug it back in!

### When You're Stuck
1. **Discriminant first** (if quadratic)
2. **Try Rational Root Theorem** (if polynomial)
3. **Factor what you can** (always simplify first)
4. **Use synthetic division** (faster than long division)
5. **Check degree and end behavior** (does graph make sense?)
