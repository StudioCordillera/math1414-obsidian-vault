# IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN: Next 5 Hours

## Hour 1 START NOW: Function Operations (4.1)
### Grab These Specific Problems:

**From your textbook Chapter 4, Section 4.1:**
1. Find (f + g)(x) - typically problems #1-5 in homework
2. Find (f/g)(x) and state domain - problems #15-20 range
3. Find (f ∘ g)(x) - problems #25-35 range  
4. Evaluate (f ∘ g)(3) - problems #40-45 range
5. Find f⁻¹(x) - problems #50-60 range

**If you don't have textbook, use these SAMPLE PROBLEMS:**

**Problem Set 1A:** f(x) = 2x + 1, g(x) = x² - 3
- Find (f + g)(x) = 2x + 1 + x² - 3 = x² + 2x - 2
- Find (f · g)(x) = (2x + 1)(x² - 3) = 2x³ - 6x + x² - 3 = 2x³ + x² - 6x - 3
- Find (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x² - 3) = 2(x² - 3) + 1 = 2x² - 6 + 1 = 2x² - 5

**Problem Set 1B:** f(x) = x/(x-2), g(x) = 1/x
- Find (f/g)(x) = (x/(x-2))/(1/x) = x²/(x-2), Domain: x ≠ 0, 2

## Hour 2: Polynomial Zeros (3.5-3.6)
### Target These Problem Types:

**Rational Root Theorem Problems:**
- Use on polynomials like: 2x³ - 5x² + x + 2
- Steps: Possible rational zeros = ±{1,2}/±{1,2} = ±1, ±2, ±1/2
- Test each using synthetic division

**SAMPLE PROBLEM 2A:** Find all zeros of P(x) = x³ - 4x² + x + 6
- Possible rational zeros: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6
- Test x = 2: Use synthetic division
- Get P(x) = (x-2)(x² - 2x - 3) = (x-2)(x-3)(x+1)
- Zeros: x = 2, 3, -1

## Hour 3: Rational Functions (4.3)
### Focus on These Problem Categories:

**Asymptote Problems:**
- Vertical: factor denominator, set = 0
- Horizontal: compare degrees of numerator/denominator
- Slant: when numerator degree is exactly 1 more than denominator

**SAMPLE PROBLEM 3A:** f(x) = (x² + 1)/(x - 2)
- Vertical Asymptote: x = 2 (denominator = 0, numerator ≠ 0)
- Slant Asymptote: Long division gives x + 2 + 5/(x-2), so y = x + 2

## Hour 4: Systems (9.1-9.2)
### Practice These Standard Types:

**Basic 2×2 Systems:**
- 2x + 3y = 7
- x - y = 1
- Solution: Substitution gives x = 1 + y, so 2(1 + y) + 3y = 7
- 2 + 2y + 3y = 7, 5y = 5, y = 1, x = 2

**3×3 System Example:**
- x + y + z = 6
- 2x - y + 3z = 14  
- x + 2y - z = 2

## Hour 5: Speed Round
### Rapid-Fire Practice:

Do 20 quick problems mixing all topics - aim for 3 minutes each.

## RIGHT NOW - START WITH THESE 3 PROBLEMS:

### PROBLEM 1 (Function Operations):
Given f(x) = 3x - 1 and g(x) = x² + 2
Find: (f ∘ g)(x) and (g ∘ f)(x)

**Solution:**
- (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x² + 2) = 3(x² + 2) - 1 = 3x² + 6 - 1 = 3x² + 5
- (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(3x - 1) = (3x - 1)² + 2 = 9x² - 6x + 1 + 2 = 9x² - 6x + 3

### PROBLEM 2 (Polynomial Zeros):
Find all real zeros of P(x) = x³ - 3x² - 10x + 24

**Solution Process:**
- Possible rational zeros: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24
- Test x = 2: P(2) = 8 - 12 - 20 + 24 = 0 ✓
- Factor: P(x) = (x - 2)(x² - x - 12) = (x - 2)(x - 4)(x + 3)
- Zeros: x = 2, 4, -3

### PROBLEM 3 (Rational Functions):
Find all asymptotes of f(x) = (2x² - 8)/(x² - 4)

**Solution:**
- Factor: f(x) = 2(x² - 4)/(x² - 4) = 2(x-2)(x+2)/(x-2)(x+2)
- This simplifies to f(x) = 2 for x ≠ ±2
- Horizontal asymptote: y = 2
- Holes at x = 2 and x = -2 (not vertical asymptotes)
