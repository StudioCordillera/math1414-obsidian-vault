## 🎯 PROBLEM-TYPE TIMING GUIDE

### Fast Problems (2-3 minutes each)

**These should be quick:**
- Discriminant classification → 1 min
- Identify polynomial degree from equation → 1 min
- Find y-intercept → 30 sec
- Identify end behavior → 1 min
- Complex conjugate of given root → 30 sec
- Sign of leading coefficient from graph → 30 sec

**Strategy:** Knock these out first!

---

### Medium Problems (4-6 minutes each)

**These need care but are routine:**
- Complete the square → 3-4 min
- Synthetic division → 3-4 min
- Solve quadratic with formula → 3-4 min
- Graph quadratic (complete features) → 5-6 min
- Find equation from vertex + point → 4-5 min
- Apply Rational Root Theorem → 4-6 min

**Strategy:** Use systematic methods, show all steps

---

### Complex Problems (7-10+ minutes each)

**These require multiple steps:**
- Factor completely, find all roots → 7-8 min
- Graph polynomial with all features → 8-10 min
- Construct equation from graph → 8-10 min
- Word problem (model + solve + interpret) → 8-10 min
- Solve polynomial inequality → 8-12 min
- Complete polynomial analysis → 10+ min

**Strategy:** If stuck after 3 minutes, mark and move on. Return later.

## 🚀 SPEED OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Mental Math Shortcuts

**Discriminant:**
```
Quick squares:
1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, 4² = 16, 5² = 25
6² = 36, 7² = 49, 8² = 64, 9² = 81, 10² = 100

Quick products:
4(1)(5) = 20, 4(2)(3) = 24, 4(3)(4) = 48
```

**Vertex (x-coordinate):**
```
If b is even and a = 1: h = -b/2 (easy division)
Ex: x² + 6x + c → h = -3

If a and b share factor: simplify first
Ex: 2x² - 12x + c → factor 2: 2(x² - 6x) → h = 3
```

### Technique 2: Strategic Calculator Use

**Use calculator for:**
- ✅ Discriminant calculation (avoid arithmetic errors)
- ✅ Quadratic formula (after setup by hand)
- ✅ Checking your factoring
- ✅ Evaluating functions at specific values

**DON'T use calculator for:**
- ❌ Simple mental math (wastes time)
- ❌ Writing out steps (must show work!)
- ❌ Graph sketching (use features instead)

### Technique 3: Strategic Partial Credit

**If running out of time:**
1. Write the setup (shows you know method)
2. Write the formula you'd use
3. Substitute values (even if you can't finish)
4. Circle or box what you'd do next

**Example:**
```
"Find roots of 3x² - 7x + 2 = 0"

If rushed, write:
x = [-(-7) ± √((-7)² - 4(3)(2))] / [2(3)]
x = [7 ± √(49 - 24)] / 6
x = [7 ± √25] / 6
[Would continue: x = (7±5)/6 → x = 2 or 1/3]
```

You'll get most points even if you don't finish!

## ⚠️ TIME TRAPS TO AVOID

### Trap 1: Perfection Paralysis
**Symptom:** Spending 15 minutes on one problem trying to get it perfect  
**Solution:** If stuck after 5 minutes, mark it and MOVE ON

### Trap 2: Expansion Obsession
**Symptom:** Expanding every factored form when not asked  
**Solution:** Only expand if problem explicitly asks for "standard form"

### Trap 3: Verification Vortex
**Symptom:** Checking same answer 3 times  
**Solution:** One quick check is enough, save deep verification for end

### Trap 4: Arithmetic Anxiety
**Symptom:** Redoing simple calculations repeatedly  
**Solution:** Trust your calculator, show your work, move on

### Trap 5: Blank Page Panic
**Symptom:** Staring at hard problem, writing nothing  
**Solution:** Write ANYTHING - the formula, the method, what you'd try. Partial credit exists!

## 🎯 POINT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Maximize Points Per Minute

**High value, low time:** Do these first
- Multiple choice (if any) → Guess if stuck
- Short answer requiring one calculation
- "Identify" or "classify" questions

**High value, high time:** Save adequate time
- Multi-part problems
- "Show all work" problems  
- Word problems

**Low value, high time:** Consider skipping if time-crunched
- Extra credit (do last)
- Problems worth few points
- Problems with "bonus" marking

## 📋 EXAM DAY CHECKLIST

### First 5 Minutes (Critical!)

**Do this IN ORDER:**
1. ✅ Write name on exam
2. ✅ Flip through - count problems
3. ✅ Note time allowed
4. ✅ Calculate: time ÷ problems = minutes per problem
5. ✅ Scan for easy ones (mark with ✓)
6. ✅ Scan for hard ones (mark with ⭐)
7. ✅ Check for word problems (need extra time)
8. ✅ Note if any problems worth more points
9. ✅ Take one deep breath
10. ✅ Start with easiest problem

### Every 20 Minutes

**Quick time check:**
- ⏰ 20 min: Should have ~5-6 problems done
- ⏰ 40 min: Should be halfway through
- ⏰ 60 min: Should have 3/4 done
- ⏰ 80 min: Should be on last 1-2 problems
- ⏰ 90 min: Final review time

**If behind:** Skip ahead to easier problems, return to hard ones

- 30 sec: Setup (identify c, write coefficients)
- 2 min: Perform division
- 30 sec: Write quotient/remainder
- 30 sec: Answer the question asked

- 2 min: Find key features (intercepts, vertex)
- 2 min: Plot points accurately
- 1-2 min: Sketch curve smoothly

**Speed tip:** Don't need 20 points - just key features!

### Word Problems
**Target:** 7-10 minutes
- 2 min: Read carefully, identify variables
- 2 min: Set up equation/model
- 3 min: Solve
- 1 min: Interpret, check reasonableness

## 🔥 FINAL TIMING WISDOM

### Three Golden Rules

**Rule 1: Done beats perfect**
A completed exam with small errors > Perfect answers on half the exam

**Rule 2: Partial credit is real**
Show your work, write your setup, demonstrate your thinking = POINTS

**Rule 3: Time is your resource**
Spend it strategically. Don't donate time to problems that don't donate points.

### If Running Out of Time (Last 10 Minutes)

**Priority order:**
1. Finish problems you're 90% done with
2. Set up remaining problems (write formulas/methods)
3. Make educated guesses on multiple choice
4. Circle answers clearly
5. Do NOT leave blanks (write something!)

### The 2-Minute Warning

**When time is almost up:**
- Stop solving new problems
- Check you answered every part of multi-part questions
- Make sure work is legible
- Verify name is on exam
- Submit with confidence!
