## 🎯 EXAM DAY SUPER-QUICK REVIEW

**Read these 10 in final 2 minutes:**

1. Δ = b² - 4ac → positive/zero/negative
2. i² = -1, complex conjugates come in pairs
3. (x + 3) → root is x = -3
4. Synthetic division: (x - c) means use c
5. Even degree → same ends, Odd degree → opposite ends
6. Positive LC → right end UP, Negative LC → right end DOWN
7. Touch x-axis = even multiplicity, Cross = odd
8. Vertex at h = -b/(2a)
9. Complete square: add/subtract (b/2)²
10. Remainder = 0 means found a factor!

## 💡 MENTAL TRIGGERS

**If you see...think:**

- "Complete the square" → Add (b/2)², factor perfect square
- "Find roots" → Check factorability first, then Quadratic Formula
- "Nature of roots" → Calculate discriminant
- "Complex root given" → Write conjugate immediately
- "Graph polynomial" → Find roots, check multiplicity, use end behavior
- "Find equation from graph" → Count zeros, note multiplicities, use point
- "(x - c) is a factor" → P(c) = 0
- "Vertex + point" → Use vertex form, solve for 'a'
- "Maximum/minimum" → Find vertex (it's always the vertex!)
