# Augmented Matrix

Definition
- An augmented matrix represents a linear system by placing the coefficient matrix and the constants column side-by-side, separated by a vertical bar.

Purpose
- Encodes the system for row operations; simplifies bookkeeping for elimination.

Example
- System → augmented matrix; show one row operation and the corresponding system transformation.

Notes
- Row-equivalence of augmented matrices corresponds to equivalence of linear systems.
