# Inequality Properties (Algebra of Inequalities)

Core Properties (for real numbers a, b, c):
- Addition: If a < b then a + c < b + c
- Subtraction: If a < b then a − c < b − c
- Multiplication (positive c): If a < b and c > 0 then ac < bc
- Multiplication (negative c): If a < b and c < 0 then ac > bc (sign reverses)
- Division mirrors multiplication (c ≠ 0)
- Transitivity: a < b and b < c ⇒ a < c

Usage:
- Solve linear inequalities like equations, but reverse the sign when multiplying/dividing by a negative.
- Combine with interval notation and number-line graphs.

Common Errors:
- Forgetting to reverse when multiplying/dividing by a negative
- Reversing when adding/subtracting (don’t)
- Mixing strict (<, >) with non-strict (≤, ≥) incorrectly
