# Definition
Constraints on input values that keep expressions defined (e.g., denominators ≠ 0; even-index radicals require radicand ≥ 0 over ℝ).

# Method (Find Domain Restrictions)
1) Identify undefined operations (division by zero, even roots of negatives, logs of non-positives, etc.).
2) Form inequalities/equalities expressing admissible inputs.
3) Solve and express set in interval notation.

# Examples
- 1/(x-3): x ≠ 3 → (-∞,3)∪(3,∞)
- √(5-2x): 5-2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 2.5

# Why It Matters
Prevents extraneous solutions and supports correct graph domains.

# Summary
Domain restrictions ensure expressions and equations make sense within ℝ (or specified codomain).
