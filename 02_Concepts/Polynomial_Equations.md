# Polynomial Equations

Definition: Equations of the form P(x) = 0 where P is a polynomial. Degree n gives at most n real roots; total complex roots count multiplicity n (FTA).

Method Selection:
1) Factor GCF first
2) Look for patterns (difference of squares/cubes, perfect squares)
3) Try trinomial factoring or grouping
4) Use Rational Root Theorem + synthetic division
5) Reduce to lower-degree factors; solve each factor = 0

Notes:
- Must set equation to 0 before using Zero Product Property
- Check for repeated (multiple) roots and their implications
- Use quadratic-in-form recognition when applicable

Common Errors:
- Canceling terms instead of factors
- Forgetting to set equal to zero
- Stopping after one factor found (keep factoring)
