# Algebraic Equations

Definition
- An algebraic equation sets two algebraic expressions equal. Classes include linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, radical, exponential, and logarithmic (last two involve variables in exponent or as log arguments).

Notes
- Solution strategies depend on type; always consider domain constraints and check for extraneous solutions where applicable.
