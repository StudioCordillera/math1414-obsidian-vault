# Row Echelon Form (REF)

Definition
- A matrix is in row echelon form if: (1) nonzero rows above zero rows; (2) leading entry of each nonzero row is to the right of the leading entry in the row above; (3) entries below a leading entry are zero.

Use
- Standard stopping point of Gaussian elimination; supports back-substitution.
