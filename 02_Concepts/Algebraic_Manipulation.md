# Algebraic Manipulation

Scope
- General-purpose techniques for transforming expressions and equations: factoring, distributing, combining like terms, applying exponent and log rules, isolating variables.

Usage
- Used across solving workflows for exponential/logarithmic equations, literal equations, and simplification tasks.

Pitfalls
- Applying rules outside their domains (e.g., splitting logs over addition; taking roots without considering sign/domain).
