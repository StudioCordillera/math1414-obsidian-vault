# Number Line Graphing (Solution Sets)

Conventions:
- Open circle for < or >; closed circle for ≤ or ≥
- Shade left for values less than a point; shade right for greater than
- For unions, draw separate shaded regions; for intersections, show overlap

Examples:
- x < 3 → open at 3, shade left; interval (−∞, 3)
- −1 ≤ x < 2 → closed at −1, open at 2; interval [−1, 2)
- x < −3 or x > 3 → two open circles at −3 and 3; (−∞, −3) ∪ (3, ∞)

Checks:
- Test a point in the shaded region to verify inequality
- Match graph with correct interval notation
