# Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Slope relationships and equation methods

---

## Definitions
- Parallel lines (non-vertical): equal slopes (m₁ = m₂)
- Perpendicular lines (non-vertical): slopes are negative reciprocals (m₂ = −1/m₁)
- Vertical vs horizontal: Vertical lines (x = a) are perpendicular to horizontal lines (y = b)

---

## Methods
1) Given a line and a point, find a parallel line
- Use the same slope m; apply point–slope with the given point

2) Given a line and a point, find a perpendicular line
- Compute m⊥ = −1/m (for nonzero, non-vertical slopes); apply point–slope

3) Determine relationship between two given lines
- Convert both to slope–intercept form; compare slopes

---

## Examples
1) Line: y = 2x − 3, point (4, 1)
- Parallel: same slope m = 2 → y − 1 = 2(x − 4) → y = 2x − 7
- Perpendicular: m⊥ = −1/2 → y − 1 = (−1/2)(x − 4) → y = (−1/2)x + 3

2) Lines: 3x − 2y = 6 and y = (3/2)x + 1
- First line slope: 3x − 2y = 6 → y = (3/2)x − 3
- Compare: (3/2) vs (3/2) → Parallel

3) Vertical/horizontal case
- Given x = −1, a perpendicular through (2,5) is y = 5

---

## Common Misconceptions
- Forgetting to use the negative reciprocal for perpendicular lines
- Misinterpreting vertical/horizontal special cases
- Assuming intersecting lines are always perpendicular

---

## Connections
- Supports line construction in applications (2.5)
- Related to distance from a point to a line (advanced)
