# Patterns
- "of" → multiplication; "per" → rate; "is" → equals.
- Increase/decrease by → +/−; total/sum → +; difference → −.
- Consecutive integers: n, n+1, n+2; even: 2k, 2k+2; odd: 2k+1, 2k+3.

# Example
"The total cost is unit price times quantity plus shipping" → C = pq + s.

# Tips
- Define variables first. Draw a diagram/table when helpful. Units matter.
