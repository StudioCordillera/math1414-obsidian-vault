# The Constant e

Definition
- e ≈ 2.71828 is the base of natural logarithms. It can be defined by the limit e = lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n or as the unique number where the derivative of e^x equals e^x at x=0.

Key properties
- ln(e) = 1; e^{ln x} = x (x>0); d/dx e^x = e^x; ∫(1/x) dx from 1 to e equals 1.

Applications
- Continuous compounding A = Pe^{rt}; exponential growth/decay y = y_0 e^{kt}; calculus foundations.
