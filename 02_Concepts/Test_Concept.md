# Test Concept Page

This is a test page to verify that Jekyll is properly processing concept files in the 02_Concepts directory.

If you can see this page with proper styling and layout, then the Jekyll configuration is working correctly.

## Test Elements

- **Frontmatter**: ✅ Working
- **Layout**: ✅ Should use concept layout
- **Permalink**: ✅ Should be accessible at `/02_Concepts/Test_Concept/`

## Math Test

Let's test MathJax rendering:

$$|x| = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

If the math renders properly, MathJax is working too!
