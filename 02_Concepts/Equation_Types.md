# Definition
- Identity: An equation true for all values in its domain (e.g., 2(x+3)=2x+6; after simplification → 0=0).
- Contradiction: An equation false for all values (e.g., x+3=x−1 → 3=−1).
- Conditional: True only for particular solutions (most equations).

# Recognition Patterns
- Always consider domain first (exclude values making denominators 0 or even roots of negatives).
- After simplifying:
  - Identity → a true statement independent of the variable (e.g., 0=0)
  - Contradiction → a false statement (e.g., 0=k with k≠0)
  - Conditional → yields specific solution(s) (e.g., x=a)

# Examples
1) 3(x−2)=3x−6 → 0=0 → Identity
2) 4x+7=4x−5 → 7=−5 → Contradiction
3) 2x−5=9 → x=7 → Conditional
4) (x+1)/(x−1) = 1 + 2/(x−1), x≠1. Simplify RHS to (x+1)/(x−1). The equation is true for all x≠1 → Identity on its domain.

# Common Misconceptions
- Treating an identity as “no solution” because variables cancel. Correct classification is Identity (infinitely many solutions in the domain).
- Ignoring domain restrictions: classifying an identity over all reals when it is only identity on its domain (e.g., x≠1 in Example 4).

# Relations and Usage
- Depends on [[Equality_Properties]].
- Used when solving [[Linear_Equations]], [[Rational_Equations]], [[Radical_Equations]].

# Summary
Equation types classify solution structures: all (identity), none (contradiction), or some (conditional) — always relative to the domain.
