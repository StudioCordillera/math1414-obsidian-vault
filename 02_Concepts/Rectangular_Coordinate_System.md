# Rectangular Coordinate System
Foundation for graphs, distance, and analytic geometry

---

## Definition
The rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate system consists of two perpendicular number lines (the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertical) intersecting at the origin (0,0). Each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the horizontal coordinate and y is the vertical coordinate.

Quadrants
- I: (x > 0, y > 0)
- II: (x < 0, y > 0)
- III: (x < 0, y < 0)
- IV: (x > 0, y < 0)

Axes and intercepts
- x-intercept: point(s) where y = 0
- y-intercept: point(s) where x = 0

## Core Formulas
Distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
- d = √[(x2 − x1)^2 + (y2 − y1)^2]

Midpoint of two points
- M = ( (x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2 )

Slope of a line through two points (when x2 ≠ x1)
- m = (y2 − y1)/(x2 − x1)

Note: Vertical lines have undefined slope; horizontal lines have slope 0.

## Examples
1) Plot (−3, 2): Left 3 units, up 2 units → Quadrant II
2) Find distance between A(1, −2) and B(5, 1):
   d = √[(5−1)^2 + (1−(−2))^2] = √(16 + 9) = 5
3) Midpoint of C(−4, 6) and D(2, −2):
   M = ( (−4+2)/2, (6+(−2))/2 ) = (−1, 2)

## Common Misconceptions
- Confusing order: (x, y) not (y, x)
- Mis-reading negative coordinates (moving the wrong direction)
- Calling slope of vertical line 0 (it is undefined)
- Forgetting that distance is always nonnegative

## Connections
- Basis for graphing all functions and relations
- Distance formula underlies circle equation (fixed distance from center)
- Slope connects to linear functions and rate of change
