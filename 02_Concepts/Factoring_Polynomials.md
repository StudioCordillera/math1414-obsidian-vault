# Factoring Polynomials (Method Overview)

Goal: rewrite a polynomial as a product of lower-degree factors to enable Zero Product solving or structural analysis.

Core checklist:
- GCF first
- Look for special products (diff squares/cubes, perfect squares)
- Trinomial factoring (ac method)
- Grouping (4 terms)
- Factor until irreducible over reals

Common pitfalls:
- Stopping after one factor
- Forgetting to check for special patterns
- Using Zero Product Property when expression ≠ 0
