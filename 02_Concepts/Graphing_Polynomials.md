# Graphing Polynomial Functions

Purpose: Practical guide to sketching polynomial graphs using structure (degree, leading coefficient), end behavior, and root multiplicities.

Core Method (overview):
- Determine degree and leading coefficient sign from standard form
- Use degree & sign to set end behavior arrows
- Find real roots (x-intercepts) and their multiplicities; mark cross vs bounce behavior
- Locate y-intercept P(0)
- Identify turning points (at most degree−1); use symmetry if applicable
- Refine shape between intercepts; check a strategic value on each interval

Common errors:
- Confusing cross vs bounce at repeated roots
- Ignoring leading coefficient effect on end behavior
- Assuming local extrema at every root (not true)
