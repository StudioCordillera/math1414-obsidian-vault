# 00_Specs Recovery

Canonical specs live at: [[System/Specs]]

If you accidentally create or edit a spec here, do one of the following:
- Drop the file here; it will be triaged into [[System/Specs/_Inbox]]
- Or paste content into [[System/Specs/_Inbox]] directly

Notes
- System/Specs contains: Node Standard, Relations - Relation Types, Tags Taxonomy
- Dashboards to validate nodes: [[Relational Cognition Corpus/Dashboards/QA - Node Compliance]], [[Relational Cognition Corpus/Dashboards/Topics Overview]], [[Relational Cognition Corpus/Dashboards/Claims Dashboard]]
