# Beck–Chevalley and Frobenius reciprocity

In a regular category R, for any pullback square, inverse image and direct image satisfy the Beck–Chevalley condition; and direct image distributes over pullback along meets (Frobenius). In particular, for regular epis e, e_! preserves finite meets.

Sketch
- Beck–Chevalley: for pullback square, f^* g_! = g'_! f'^* on subobject lattices.
- Frobenius: f_!(A ∧ f^*(B)) = f_!(A) ∧ B.
