Statement
- In familiar categories (e.g., sets with structure), there exists an adjoint chain Components ⊣ Discrete ⊣ Points ⊣ Codiscrete. This expresses universal properties of quotienting to components, embedding discrete objects, taking points/fixed-points, and forming codiscrete objects.

Examples
- For group actions, components are orbits; points are fixed points. For monoid actions with constants, codiscrete objects abound.
