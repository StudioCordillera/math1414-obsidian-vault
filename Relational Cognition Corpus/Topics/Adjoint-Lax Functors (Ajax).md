# Adjoint-Lax (Ajax) Functors

Idea:
- A functor P: C → Poset is adjoint-lax if its laxators are right adjoints; operationally, it preserves meets and has Galois connections underlying substitution.

Why it matters:
- For regular calculi, contexts map to posets of predicates; substitutions act via right adjoints (existential quantification left adjoint to pullback).
