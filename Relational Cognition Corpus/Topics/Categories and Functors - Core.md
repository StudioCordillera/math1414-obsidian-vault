Categories and Functors — Core

Essentials
- Category: objects, morphisms, identities, associative composition.
- Structure-preserving maps between structures appear as functors between categories.
- Natural transformation: components η_X: F(X) → G(X) commuting with all morphisms f.

Canonical facts
- Isomorphisms: invertible morphisms; equivalence of categories via fully faithful + essentially surjective functors.
- Products: object X×Y with projections; universal property characterizes it uniquely up to unique iso.
- Coproducts: dual of products; injections and universal property.
- Pullbacks/pushouts: limit/colimit squares; pullbacks capture substitution and fibered reasoning.

Use in corpus
- Regular categories rely on finite limits + stable image factorizations.
- Natural transformations (e.g., laxators) are core in Graphical Regular Logic’s ajax functors.
