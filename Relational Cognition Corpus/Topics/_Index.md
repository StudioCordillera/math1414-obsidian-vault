# Topics Index (Content-centric)

Guiding rule: Topics aggregate content from multiple sources. If content is uniquely single-source, note that explicitly.

Core topics to seed:
- Regular Logic and Graphical Regular Logic
- Regular Categories
- Bicategory of Relations
- Syntactic Categories and Internal Relations
- Adjunctions and Adjoint-Lax (Ajax) Functors
- Adjoint Monoids and Meet-Semilattices
- Conjunctive Queries and Databases (bridge)
- Categories: Objects/Morphisms; Limits; Products/Pullbacks; Monos/Epis
- Functors and Natural Transformations; Yoneda; Equivalences
- Cartesian Closed Categories; Curry–Howard–Lambek (bridge)

Status (2025-10-16)
- Built initial topic scaffolds and seeded GRL + L&S extracts
- Next: add page-cited entries and examples; expand Adjunctions/Monads, CCC, Yoneda
