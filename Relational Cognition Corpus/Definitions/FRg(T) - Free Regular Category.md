# FRg(T) — Free Regular Category on a Context T

Definition: For a finite-context signature T, FRg(T) is the free regular category generated by T, obtained by freely adding finite limits and stable image factorizations subject to the regular axioms. Objects are contexts; morphisms are equivalence classes of regular formulas in context.

Notes
- Serves as the domain for a regular calculus P: FRg(T) → Poset.
- The po-category of relations Rel_FRg(T) supplies the ambient for graphical regular logic.
