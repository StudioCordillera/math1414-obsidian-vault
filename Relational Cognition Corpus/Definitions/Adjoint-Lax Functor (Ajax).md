# Adjoint-Lax Functor (Ajax)

Definition
- A functor P: C → Poset is adjoint-lax (ajax) if it is lax monoidal with laxator maps whose components admit right adjoints, coherently.
- In GRL, a regular calculus is an ajax functor P: FRg(T) → Poset from the free regular category on a context T.

Notes
- Ajax structure induces finite meets (∧) and truth (⊤) in each fiber P(Γ), with substitutions preserving ∧ and ⊤, and with left adjoints (∃) satisfying Beck–Chevalley and Frobenius.
