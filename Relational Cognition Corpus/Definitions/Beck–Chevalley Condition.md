# Beck–Chevalley Condition

Statement
- For a pullback square in a regular category, inverse image (pullback) and direct image (left adjoint to pullback along regular epis) commute: f_! ∘ g^* ≅ h^* ∘ k_!.

Interpretation
- Ensures substitution and existential quantification commute along pullbacks; guarantees stability of regular logic under change of variables.

Context
- Phrased for the Sub functor Sub_R: each f: X→Y induces f^*: Sub(Y)→Sub(X) with left adjoint f_! when f is a regular epi; Beck–Chevalley requires natural isomorphism for pullback squares.
