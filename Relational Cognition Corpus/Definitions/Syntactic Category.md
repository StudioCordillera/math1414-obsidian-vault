# Syntactic Category (Regular Logic)

Definition (sketch)
- Objects: contexts Γ of FRg(T); morphisms: equivalence classes of regular formulas ϕ(x,y) modulo provable entailment, with composition by existential composition and conjunction. This yields a regular category equivalent to R_P for the associated regular calculus P.
