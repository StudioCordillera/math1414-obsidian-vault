Definition
- Given a regular calculus P: FRg(T) → Poset, the category R_P of internal functions has objects contexts and morphisms functional internal relations; it forms a regular category.

Anchors (added)
- GRL §7: Internal functions R_P = LAdj(IntRel_P); finite limits (terminal, pullbacks) and image factorizations (stable under pullback).
- GRL Thm 7.3: R_P is regular.

Notes
- Characterizations: functions ≡ relations with transpose as right adjoint ≡ total + deterministic (Thm 7.6).
- Images: θ regular epi ⇔ φ2 = im(θ) (Prop 7.17). Factorization θ = (regular epi) ∘ (mono).

Anchors
- GRL §7: R_P as internal functions (maps) reconstructed from IntRel_P; finite limits and pullback-stable images inherited; evaluation of graphs-as-left-adjoints.
