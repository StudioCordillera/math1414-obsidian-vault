# Regular Category

Statement
- A category R is regular if it has finite limits and every morphism factors as a regular epimorphism followed by a monomorphism, with regular epis stable under pullback.

Context
- Ensures existence of images stable under pullback, enabling a semantics for existential quantification and composition of relations.

Notes
- Equivalent conditions: coequalizers of kernel pairs, etc.
