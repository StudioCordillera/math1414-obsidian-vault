# Regular Calculus

Statement
- A regular calculus on a context T is an adjoint-lax (ajax) functor P: FRg(T) → Poset, where the laxators have specified right adjoints.

Context
- Encodes the regular fragment’s predicates as a poset-valued functor, enabling graphical reasoning and reconstruction of a regular category.
