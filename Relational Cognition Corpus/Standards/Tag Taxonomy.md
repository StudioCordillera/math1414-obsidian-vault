Title: Tag Taxonomy (Mathematical Relational Vault)

Purpose
- Provide a controlled vocabulary for tags to improve findability and graph clarity.

Top-level tags
- #topic — conceptual pages
- #definition — atomic definitional entries
- #theorem — formal statements
- #example — illustrative instances
- #proof — proof objects
- #publication — bibliographic entries

Subject tags
- #cat-theory — Category theory
- #logic — Logic (general)
- #regular-logic — Regular logic fragment
- #relations — Relations and Relational algebra
- #grl — Graphical Regular Logic
- #limits — Limits and universal properties
- #functors — Functors and naturality
- #adjunctions — Adjunctions and monads
- #ccc — Cartesian closed categories / exponentials
- #sets — Sets and functions
- #lattices — Orders and lattices
- #truth — Subobject classifier / truth values
- #db — Databases and conjunctive queries
- #syntax — Syntactic categories / calculus
- #semantics — Semantic categories / models
- #history — Historical/contextual notes

Workflow tags
- #seeded — minimal content added
- #in-progress — being actively developed
- #needs-citation — content present but missing page anchors
- #needs-example — needs at least one example
- #reviewed — vetted for accuracy/completeness
- #canonical — considered stable reference

Guidelines
- Combine at most 3–5 subject tags per note
- Always include exactly one top-level tag matching node type
- Add workflow tags sparingly and remove when resolved
