# Extraction Queue

Goal: Extract content into topic-centric notes. Track progress per publication (not for templates/guides).

Status legend: ☐ Not started | ◐ In progress | ✓ Key results captured | ⧗ Add page refs | ! Needs review

- [FongSpivak2019] Graphical Regular Logic — ◐ In progress; ✓ core results summarized; ⧗ add page refs
- [LawvereSchanuel1997-2009] Conceptual Mathematics — ☐ Not started
- [ChengLauda] Higher-Dimensional Categories: Illustrated — ☐ Not started
- [PeterSmith2026] Introducing Category Theory — ☐ Not started
- [LawvereRosebrugh2003] Sets for Mathematics — ☐ Not started (dedupe copies)
- [GowersCompanion] Princeton Companion to Mathematics — ☐ Not started (dedupe copies)
- [Carothers2000] Real Analysis — ☐ Not started (bridge to categorical viewpoints only when relevant)
- [SEP-CategoryTheory] Stanford Encyclopedia: Category Theory — ☐ Not started
- [AlgebraOfLogic] The Algebra of Logic Tradition — ☐ Not started
- [NovakCanas] Concept Mapping Tool — ☐ Not started

Notes:
- Deduplicate “Sets for Mathematics” and “Princeton Companion” entries; maintain canonical filename list in Publications Index.
- Topic notes must aggregate content across sources; only create source-specific notes when content is uniquely single-source.
